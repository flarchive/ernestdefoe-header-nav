 * The first version read `.IndexPage-nav` out of the DOM, which only exists on
 * the discussion list, renders after the header, and is replaced outright by
 * some themes (Bespoke draws its own row). Asking the component for its items
 * works on every page, before anything has rendered, under any theme — and it
 * is the same list every theme builds its pills or tiles from.
 *
 * Separators, the per-tag links and "More tags…" are the sidebar's structure
 * and are never offered. Everything else is: a LINK can go in the header; an
 * entry that is not a link (a button such as "Mark all as read") can only be
 * kept in the menu or hidden, because there is nothing to send a visitor to.
